p5a - AIM : Consider an array of names. We have to find out how many of them start with the 
letter "a". Create an automation where the number of names starting with "a" is counted and 
the result is displayed. 
Steps: 
1. Create a new sequence.
2. Drag and drop multiple assign activity
3. Create a string array and add the names you wish to add 
Names=New String[5]{“Aman”,”Ajay”,”Omkar”,”Ashish”,”Tejas”}
4. Once the array is created, go to the variable tab and change the data type of the array to 
Array of [T] and select the datatype as string.
5. Once array is created, create a new variable i=0 for iteration and count=0 and select the 
datatype as Int32 for both the variables.
6. Once done, Drag and drop a while activity from activities panel.
7. Add condition as i<5 
8. In the body panel of the while activity, drag and drop an if activity
9. Add the following condition in the if activity:
Names[i].StartsWith(“A”)
10. Drag and drop an assign activity in the “then” panel of the if activity and add 
Count=count+1(This will increase the counter by 1 if the condition is true)
11. After the else panel in the if activity, drag and drop an assign activity and add 
i=i+1
12. Outside the while loop in the main sequence, drag and drop writeline activity and add:
Count.ToString().
13. Run the automation and check the output
