p2a - AIM : Automate UiPath Number Calculation (Subtraction, Multiplication, Division of 
numbers). 
Steps:
1. Create a new sequence.
2. In the sequence, drag and drop an assign box to assign a variable. Assign a variable 
“a” with value 10.
3. On the variables tab, create the variable and assign the variable type as Int32.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to create another variable “b” of integer type and give it the 
value 15.
5. Add a third assign box and create a variable “result” that will store the value of the 
operation between a and b. (a+b). This variable will also be integer.
6. Once done, drag and drop a write line box and add: “Addition is” + result since the 
output will be in string format.
7. Repeat steps from 5 and 6 thrice and change the operation as result=a-b, result=a*b, 
result=a/b.
8. Run the automation



p2b - AIM :An automation UiPath project using different types of variables (number, datetime, 
Boolean, generic, array, data table)
STEPS :
To create array
1. Create a new sequence.
2. Drag and drop multiple assign activity.
3. Create an array variable a where,
 marks = new int[5]{99,100,50,22,98}
4. Once done, go to variable option and change the data type of the array to array of [T]. 
Click on the option and select the array type as int 32.
5. Create another variable i=0 where i will be the iteration.
6. Drag and drop while activity. In the condition part add i<5
7. In the body drag and drop writeline and add marks[i].ToString() to display the array
8. Finally drag and drop a new assign and add i=i+1 to increase the iteration by 1. This 
will display all the members of the array.
9. Run the automation and check the output.
