p3a - AIM : An automation UiPath Project using decision statements. 
Theory:
The If activity contains a statement and two conditions. The first condition (the activity in the 
Then section) is executed if the statement is true, while the second one (the activity in the 
optional Else section) is executed if the statement is false.
If activities can be useful to make decisions based on the value of variables.
STEPS:
1. Create a new sequence.
2. Drag and drop multiple assign activity.
3. Create an array variable a where,
marks = new int[5]{99,100,50,22,98}
4. Once done, go to variable option and change the data type of the array to array of [T]. 
Click on the option and select the array type as int 32.
5. Create another variable i=0 where I will be the iteration.
6. Drag and drop while activity. In the condition part add i<5
7. In the body of the while activity, drag and drop the if activity and add the condition:
Marks[i]>50
8. In the “then” panel drag and drop writeline activity and add marks[i].ToString() to 
display the array
9. Finally drag and drop a new assign outside the if activity and add i=i+1 to increase the 
iteration by 1. This will display all the members of the array.
10. Run the automation and check the output






p3b - AIM : An automation UiPath Project using looping statements. 
STEPS :
For-each activity
1. Create a new sequence.
2. Drag and drop assign activity.
3. Create an array variable marks where,
a. marks = new int[5]{99,100,50,22,98}
4. Once done, go to variable option and change the data type of the array to array of [T]. 
Click on the option and select the array type as int 32.
5. Drag and drop for each activity.
6. In the ForEach activity add the following statements:
 In “for each” field add item 
 Add marks in “In” field
7. In the body drag and drop writeline and add item.ToString() to display the array
8. Run the automation and check the output.
