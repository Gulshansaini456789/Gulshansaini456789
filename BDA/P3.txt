Practical 3
Aim - Create your own data for years of experience and salary in lakhs and apply linear regression model to predict the salary.
A)Code -
years_of_exp = c(7,5,1,3)
salary_in_lakhs = c(21,13,6,8)
#employee.data = data.frame(satisfaction_score, years_of_exp, salary_in_lakhs)
employee.data = data.frame(years_of_exp, salary_in_lakhs) employee.data
# Estimation of the salary of an employee, based on his year of experience and satisfaction score in his company.
model <- lm(salary_in_lakhs ~ years_of_exp, data = employee.data)
summary(model)
# The formula of Regression becomes
# Y = 2 + 2.5*year_of_Exp
# Visualization of Regression
plot(salary_in_lakhs ~ years_of_exp, data = employee.data) abline(model)

B)Code -
install.packages("ISLR")
library(ISLR)
#load dataset
data <- ISLR::Default
print (head(ISLR::Default))
#view summary of dataset
summary(data)
#find total observations in dataset
nrow(data)
#Create Training and Test Samples
#split the dataset into a training set to train the model on and a testing set to test the model
set.seed(1)
#Use 70% of dataset as training set and remaining 30% as testing set sample <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), nrow(data), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.7,0.3))
print (sample)
train <- data[sample, ]
test <- data[!sample, ]
nrow(train)
nrow(test)
# Fit the Logistic Regression Model
# use the glm (general linear model) function and specify family="binomial"
#so that R fits a logistic regression model to the dataset
model <- glm(default~student+balance+income, family="binomial", data=train)
#view model summary summary(model)
#Model Diagnostics
