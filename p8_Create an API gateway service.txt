Create an API gateway service

a) Create an API Management Service.
Steps for creating an API management service are mentioned below-
Step 1- Sign-in to your Azure Subscription Portal
Step 2- Search for “API Management”, then select API Management in order to create a service instance.
Step 3- As shown in Image 1 Select “API Management service”
Step 4- As API management service page is loaded, select “Create API management service” button. As shown in the image 2.
Step 5- We will be able to see the Azure API Management service creation blade as shown in Image after clicking on the “Create API management service” button
Step 6- Provide a name. This name sets the URL of the API gateway and portal [Name- AzureManagementService]
Step 7-Select the subscription and resource group (or create a new resource group), and select the location. [ Resource Name- AzureManagementService, Location- SouthEast Asia]
Step 8-Specify the organization name. This name will appear in the developer portal as the organization that publishes the API. [Name- CloudApplicationPratical]
Step 9- Specify the email address of the administrator. The user who creates the service instance will be the default administrator, so it's best to provide the email address of this user until you want someone else to serve as administrator. [Email ID- aishwarya1234567@hotmail.com]
Step 10 -Select the pricing tier. The Developer tier is the most comprehensive offering, with sufficient request/response limitations in dev/test scenarios.
Step 11-After Completing the form click on review + create button to create “Azure API Management service instance”. As shown in image 4
Step 12-As shown in the image 5 the status is “Running Final Validation”. Wait for it to be in “Validation Passed” Stage.
Step 13-Once the Validation is done and the label displays “Validation Passed”, Click on create button to create the instance of the service.
Step 14- After clicking on the create button the API management service instance will go to deployment stage as shown in image 7.
 After the deployment is complete the instance will be shown as in image 8
Next step is Import an API into API Management and test the API in the Azure portal
Step 15- In the Azure portal, search for and select API Management services.
Step 16- On the API Management services page, select your API Management instance as in image 9.
Step 17- In the left navigation of API Management instance, select APIs.
Step 18- Select the OpenAPI tile as shown in image 10.
Step 19- In the Create from OpenAPI specification window, select Full.
Step 20- Enter the values as mentioned below in the form shown in image 11
Next steps are to Test the new API in the Azure portal
Step 21- In the left navigation of your API Management instance, select APIs > Demo Conference API.
Step 22- Select the Test tab, and then select GetSpeakers. The page shows Query parameters and Headers, if any. The Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key is filled in automatically for the subscription key associated with this API.
Step 22- Select Send as shown in image 12.
As we can see in image 12 the Https response is “200 Ok with some data” which states that the backend can response.

Step 3- Select Import from the REST API selection as shown in image 2.
Step 4- Select Import from swagger and copy or select the swagger file as shown in image 3.
Step 5- To Create an API definition in Swagger. First login to the swagger account. As depicted in image 4.
Step 6- Then fill the Form which includes the version, name and other details click on Create API button. As depicted in image 5.

Step 7- Copy the API and definition from swagger as shown in image 6
Step 8-Paste the definition and in In the Settings section, select the endpoint type. Select “Edge Optimized” option and then click on import button as shown in image 7
